    <h2>My Education</h2>
      <p>I am a senior at Arizona State University pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems. I have interned in Cybersecurity for 6 months and recently got a certificate in Cloud Security Knowledge. All of the certificates and resumes can be found on the <a href="Documents.html">documents</a> page of my website. </p>
      <p>My educational aspirations include going to graduate school. Here's where I get conflicted though: I have so many things I want to study! When I was young, I wanted to go into microbiology and study infectious diseases. While that is a complete left turn from what I am currently doing, a part of me still dreams about it because I still love to read about epidemiology! I really recommend all of Richard Preston's novels, such as "The Hot Zone" or "The Demon in the Freezer". They're all very fascinating! </p>
    <p>Realistically though, if I were to stay closer to my current degree, I would want to stay in cyber security and maybe go on to study cryptography. I am going to get a few years of experience working first, to make sure this is what I want to do, but after that, I fully intent on coming back to school for a Masters. Maybe I will even go on and get a PhD. </p>
    <p>For the time being, while I work towards graduation, I am going to simultaneously try and get some certificates. I got my first one on 9/27 on Cloud Security. I might go on and do the security+ next.</p>
